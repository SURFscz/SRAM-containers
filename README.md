# SRAM-containers
Containers for SURF Research Access Management.

This prepository provides containers for all separate containers that comprise the SURF Research Access Management platform.  Together with the deploy scripts in SURFscz/SRAM-deploy, this allows you to deploy a SURF Research Access Management clone in a (plain docker) containerenvironment.

Please be aware that this is very mucht work in progress.  We plan to fully move to a container-based workflow during 2024.
